# Save Behavior Fixed âœ…

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. **No More Aggressive Dialogs** âœ…

- **After**: Dialog only shows when user tries to navigate away or manually triggered

### 2. **No Real-time Saving** âœ… 
- **Before**: Every slider move, scroll, form input triggered saves
- **After**: Changes are batched and saved only when user clicks "Save All Changes"

### 3. **Proper UX Flow** âœ…
- **Before**: Confusing auto-save conflicts with manual save
- **After**: Clean batch save - all changes saved at once

### 4. **Better Dialog Messages** âœ…
- **Before**: "Unsaved Changes Detected" (aggressive)
- **After**: "You Have Unsaved Changes" (informative)
- Added "Continue Editing" option
