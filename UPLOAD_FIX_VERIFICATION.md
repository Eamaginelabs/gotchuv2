# Upload Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed âœ…
The "Invalid asset type" error has been resolved!

### Problem:
- Frontend was sending `background` to backend
- Backend expected `backgroundImage`
- Asset type mismatch caused "Invalid asset type" error

### Solution Applied:
1. **Fixed frontend asset type mapping**:
   - Changed `'background'` â†’ `'backgroundImage'` in file upload calls
   - Updated FileUpload component to use `backgroundImage` type
   - Updated CustomizationSettings to use correct asset types

2. **Backend asset types now properly matched**:
   - âœ… `backgroundImage` - for background images  
   - âœ… `avatar` - for profile avatars
   - âœ… `audio` - for background music
   - âœ… `cursor` - for custom cursors

### Test Your PNG Upload:
1. Go to your customization page
2. Try uploading `FingerMainV2.png` again
3. It should now upload successfully!

### Files Updated:
- `/src/components/pages/CustomizationPage.jsx` - Fixed asset type from 'background' to 'backgroundImage'
- `/src/components/ui/FileUpload.jsx` - Updated type config for 'backgroundImage'
- `/src/components/ui/CustomizationSettings.jsx` - Fixed upload handlers and error handling

The PNG upload should now work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
